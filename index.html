            <p>
              Milford & District Resource Centre is focused primarily on
              community development of the wider Milford area. This involves
              supporting community groups and sports clubs in whichever way we
              can, including grant applications for funding, strategic planning,
              good governance and training.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also apply for funds centrally for the town to develop certain
              aspects such as leisure facilities, tourism infrastructure and
              anything else that will contribute to the economic, social and
              community development of the town and surrounding area. At MDRC we
              believe in working in partnership with as many stakeholders as
              possible, and are always keen to hear from members of the
              community about any problems or ideas they may have that we can
              work with them on.
